# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Add optional female `entry_slot_length` support to the sliding-dovetail
  interface, creating a straight -X approach mask sized from the clearanced
  female root envelope so the male can sit ahead of the channel before insertion.

### Changed

- Add a two-image root README preview backed by generated production output;
  show the separate male/female dovetail pair alongside the integral-lock
  section so the library interface is easier to understand at a glance.

## v0.1.0

### Added

- Initial reusable mechanical-interface library structure.
- Object-based FDM sliding-dovetail interface with derived mouth geometry.

- Top-level `sliding_dovetail_create()` facade that owns lower-level lock/spring configuration.
- Optional automatic flex cavity behind the female spring tongue.
- Entry-edge locking threshold with a straight male screwdriver-release opening.
- Numbered verification renders and STL fixtures in a neutral inspection orientation.
